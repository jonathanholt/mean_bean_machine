# Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine
A popular puzzle game researched for the Sega Mega Drive in Europe and the Sega Genesis in the USA. 
The mechanics of the game (one in a long line of 'Puyo Puyo' games) are explained here:

## About ##

The game is being built in Unity 2D from scratch. All code has been developed by me completely individually. Other assets used in the project, as well as copyright information, will follow shortly.

## History ##

### Pre-Alpha Build 0.1 - 20th February ###

The game is in semi-working order. The logic of the game works from a single player perspective and most animations, UI elements and events are all in place. Virtually every feature requires some tweaks and improvements and some features are completely missing. 
Two particular features are missing; any form of AI behaviour and also nuissance bean functionality.
